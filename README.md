> As there are now some trustworthy institutional sources that gather worldwide data, I decided to archive this project as there wasn't any purpose in continuing it.


# coronavirus-data

Covid-19 data, updated each half hour.

Data files are located in `data`. There are two files: `map.json` and `history.json`.
- `map.json` contains the actual state of the covid-19 propagation by region.
- `history.json` gives all the information about the evolution of the situation based on the past days.

Files are updated each half hour.
